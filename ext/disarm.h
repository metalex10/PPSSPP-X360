// This stuff only disassembles very old ARM but should be sufficient
// for the basics except for MOVW/MOVT.



// Disarm itself has the license you can see in the cpp file.
// I'm not entirely sure it's 100% gpl compatible but it's nearly
// public domain so meh.

// The only changes I've done is C++ compat and replaced the main
// program with this function.
