PSP Tool for encoding save data from PPSSPP to read on PSP and decoding 
PSP save to read on PPSSPP.

Alpha version. Was only tested on Project Dive Extend.


Build
=====

Require PSP Toolchain with PSP SDK


make release
This will build ppssppsavetool.prx and kernelcall.prx.

clean : make allclean


How to use
==========

Require PSP Toolchain with PRX Link and usb link, pspsh to work. Seems 
there is limitation for directories listing when running directly the 
tool from the PSP.

A) PREPARING DATA
=================

1) Play the game on PPSSPP until a game save is done. This will create 
the file "ENCRYPT_INFO.BIN" in the save directory. It contain the 
encoding key and sdk version of the game. This file is the same for all 
save of the game, so you can use it on different save folder without 
the need to make them all on PPSSPP.

2) Run usbhostfs_pc. Then mount .ppsspp/PSP/SAVEDATA directory :
mount 1 <path to .ppsspp/PSP/SAVEDATA>
If you enter "drives", you should see host1: mapped to the directory.

3) Run PRX Link on the psp, and pspsh on the PC.

B) ENCODING A SAVE FROM PPSSPP TO PSP
=====================================

1) From pspsh, run ppssppsavetool.prx.

2) In the menu, select "Encrypt", "host1:/". This will list the 
directories in ppsspp save directory which can be encoded.
For a directory to appear, it must contain the ENCRYPT_INFO.BIN file, 
and the files of a ppsspp save.

3) After selecting the directory to encode, it will be copied into 
the PSP/SAVEGAME directory and encoded. Now you can play the save on 
the PSP.

C) DECODING A SAVE FROM PSP TO PPSSPP
=====================================

1) You should have a directory in the PPSSPP save directory with the 
same name that the PSP save you want to convert. And in it, the 
"ENCRYPT_INFO.BIN" file.

Ex : You want to decrypt the save in ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA/XXXXYYY/
You create .ppsspp/PSP/SAVEDATA/XXXXYYY/ if not existing, and put the 
"ENCRYPT_INFO.BIN" generated before in it.

2) From pspsh, run ppssppsavetool.prx.

3) In the menu, select "decrypt", "host1:/". You should see your 
directory in the list.

4) After selecting it, the game decode the save and save it into the 
PPSSPP save directory. You can now launch your game in PPSSPP and load 
the save.
